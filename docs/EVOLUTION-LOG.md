# EVOLUTION LOG

## 0 · 2026-08-09 · baseline · (system armed)
scores: U6 L7 D8 De7 A4 P7
shipped: v8→v15 in two days (portal projection, JARVIS core, φ system, walls-as-OS
tile grids). Loop armed with EVOLUTION.md as the constitution.
evidence: live hash==local at v15; frames clean through tour; screenshots read.
next-observe: ALIVE is the weakest axis — the deployed site's data age climbs all
day ("data 2 h old"). Backlog #1 (fresh-data automation) is the obvious first pick.

## 1 · 2026-08-09 · fundamental · ALIVE
scores: U6 L7 D8 De7 A4->8 P7
shipped: fresh-data automation actually armed. Diagnosis: ClaudeOrreryRefresh existed
but trigger was daily-not-hourly, StopOnIdleEnd=true (idle death), and refresh.cmd
deployed lock-less with bare `vercel` (PATH-fragile under scheduler). Fixed all three:
re-registered MINUTE:60 idle-safe via claude-task.ps1, refresh.cmd now lock-wrapped
with full vercel.cmd path.
evidence: /run fired end-to-end (log: gen-data -> lock -> push -> deployed -> released,
exit 0); live fleet.json exported 08:18Z, ~7 min old at check; next run hourly.
next-observe: header data-age on the live page through a full hour; then backlog #2
(tiles are dead - click a wall tile should open that agent's card).
